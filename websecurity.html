		  <h2>Domain Name</h2>
			<h3>What is a domain name? </h3>
			<p>Domain names are easy to remember words that we can use to communicate to a DNS server the website you want to visit. The Domain Name System (DNS) is what translates the friendly name to an IP address.
			The domain name hides the IP address that most people aren't interested in seeing or using, like the 172.217.23.14 address used by google.com.
			</p>
			
			<h4>How they are made up?</h4>
			<p> A domain is created using the following 6-step protocol</p>
		    <img src="images/URL.PNG" width="100%"  alt="URL EXAMPLE"/>
<p>Part 1 - Transfer Protocol
			http:// – Hypertext Transfer Protocol
			https:// – Hypertext Transfer Protocol, Secure
			ftp:// - File Transfer Protocol for FTP site. Allows upload/download of files.
			<p>Part 2 – www (which part of internet is being addressed)</p>
			<p>Part 3 – domain name – name of organisation that controls the site that the page is stored on</p>
			<p>Part 4 – indicates the type of organisation (.co/.sch/.gov/.edu/.org etc) </p>
			<p>Part 5 – the name of the folder</p>
			<p>Part 6 – the name of the file and file extension</p>

			</p>

					<li>An active link is underlined and red</li>
				</ul>
				
	<pre><code class="language-css">a:link {
	color: green; 
	background-color: transparent; 
	text-decoration: none;
}

a:visited {
	color: pink;
	background-color: transparent;

		<section id="navigation">
			  <h2>What is a Navigation Bar and why are they important</h2>
			  <p>A navigation bar is a collection or group of hyperlinks that allow a user to navigate around a website. 
				They are important because they make finding sections of the website much easier for the user. Instead of knowing URLs they can simply click on a hyperlink</p>
			<p>Off screen navigation comes from off one side of the screen, and act as a normal menu. They can be pushed back off the side of the screen. 
			These are good as they are compact, and only take up space when the user is going to use them. A search bar can be included at the top of the menu, which allows the user to search for terms or for certain categories.

It can be either a document in any form used as a planning tool for web design, or a web page that lists the pages on a web site, typically organized in hierarchical fashion.

		<section id="database">
	  <h2>Database</h2>
	  <h3>What is a relational database?</h3>
	  <p>A relational database is based on the model invented by IBM’s E.F. Codd in the 1970s. Relational databases, use Structured Querying Language (SQL) and can manage a variety of transaction-oriented applications. They present data in tabular form and provide relational operators to manipulate data in tabular form. </p>
	  <h4>What is a non-relational database?</h4>
	  <p>A non-relational database is modeled by means other than the tabular system used in the relational database. A major advantage of the non-relational database is that it can easily incorporate and store all kinds of Big Data, including unstructured and semi-structured data. Design is generally simpler and allows users to perform operations faster. As a community grows, non-relational databases can scale automatically.</p>
	  <h5>What are flat file databases?</h5>
	  <p>A flat file database is a database that stores data in a plain text file. Each line of the text file holds one record, with fields separated by delimiters, such as commas or tabs.While it uses a simple structure, a flat file database cannot contain multiple tables like a relational database can.</p>
	  <h6>Examples of flat file databases:</h6>
	  <p>A flat file database is basically a giant collection of data in which the tables and records have no relation between any other tables.In fact, one could have a single table (e.g., My Small Business Data) with everything stored in it, from customers to sales to orders to invoices.</p>

	  <h2>What is the World Wide Web Consortium?
</h2>
	  <p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international community where Member organizations, a full-time staff, and the public work together to develop Web standards.</p>
	  <h3>Open and closed standards in web development</h3>
	  <p>An open standard is a standard that is publicly available and has various rights to use associated with it, and may also have various properties of how it was designed. A closed standard is a file format, protocol or program which has wide public acceptance, but which does not comply with the requirements for a free/libre or open standard.</p>
